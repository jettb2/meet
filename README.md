<p> In this project we will be creating a meet app that is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.</p>

<h1>User Story - </h1>

<p> As a user, I should be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event. </p>

<p> As a user, I should be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once. </p>

<p> As a user, I should be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online. </p>

<p> As a user, I should be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city. </p>
